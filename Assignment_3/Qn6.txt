Facts:

// INCORRECT LABELS 

L1W => ~C1W  // asserts that if the label on Box 1 indicates it contains white tennis balls, then the actual contents of Box 1 do not include white tennis balls
L1Y => ~C1Y
L1B => ~C1B

L2W => ~C2W
L2Y => ~C2Y
L2B => ~C2B

L3W => ~C3W
L3Y => ~C3Y
L3B => ~C3B

// ALL DIFFERENT TYPES

C1W ^ C2Y => C3B // means if Box 1 contains white tennis balls and Box 2 contains yellow tennis balls, then Box 3 contains both white and yellow tennis balls.
C1W ^ C2B => C3Y
C1Y ^ C2W => C3B
C1Y ^ C2B => C3W
C1B ^ C2W => C3Y
C1B ^ C2Y => C3W

// LABELS AND OBSERVATIONS SHOULD NOT MATCH SINCE LABELS ARE INCORRECT

O1W ^ L1W => ~C1W // means if both the observation and the label from Box 1 indicate it contains white tennis balls, then it logically follows that Box 1 does not contain white tennis balls.
O1Y ^ L1Y => ~C1Y

O2W ^ L2W => ~C2W
O2Y ^ L2Y => ~C2Y

O3W ^ L3W => ~C3W
O3Y ^ L3Y => ~C3Y

// OBSERVATIONS SHOULD BE A SUBSET OF ACTUAL CONTENT

O1W => C1W V C1B // If an observation indicates a white tennis ball was drawn from Box 1, it logically follows that either Box 1 contains white tennis balls or it contains both white and yellow tennis balls
O1Y => C1Y V C1B
O1W => ~C1Y
O1Y => ~C1W

O2W => C2W V C2B
O2Y => C2Y V C2B
O2W => ~C2Y
O2Y => ~C2W

O3W => C3W V C3B
O3Y => C3Y V C3B
O3W => ~C3Y
O3Y => ~C3W



LETS SOLVE THE THIRD BOX FIRST: 

GIVEN DATA - L3B, O3Y

L3B => ~C3B
AND O3Y => C3Y V C3B
SINCE C3B IS FALSE AND 03Y IS TRUE THEN C3Y MUST BE TRUE. THEREFORE, BOX 3 CONTAINS YELLOW.

NOW LETS SOLVE FOR BOX 1
L1W => ~C1W
O1W => ~C1Y

THUS BOX 1 MUST CONTAIN BOTH, SO C1B IS TRUE

AND NOW FOR THE SECOND BOX 
C1B ^ C2W => C3Y
THEREFORE C2W IS TRUE.

HENCE PROVED!
